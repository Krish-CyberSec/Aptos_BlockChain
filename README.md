NFT Auction House
Project Description
The NFT Auction House is a decentralized smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that enables users to create and participate in NFT auctions. This contract provides a simple yet robust platform for auctioning digital assets, allowing NFT owners to list their tokens for auction and bidders to compete for ownership through a transparent bidding process.

The contract implements core auction functionality including auction creation, bid placement, automatic refund mechanisms for outbid participants, and secure fund transfers using AptosCoin. It ensures fair and transparent price discovery for NFTs while maintaining the security and immutability that blockchain technology provides.
